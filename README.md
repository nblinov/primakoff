# Primakoff
A simple program to generate $$\gamma + N \to a + N$$ events where 
N is a nucleus and $a$ an axion-like particle.

This code was written as part of the paper (Axion-like particle searches at DarkQuest)<https://inspirehep.net/literature/1993934> with 
Elizabeth Kowalczyk and Margaret Wynne.
